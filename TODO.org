* The AutomtionY 

The AutomationY project is research project to make a replica of the AutomationX V4.x system.

** Milestones

 - [X] Make a proof-of-concept virtual machine, which is using pointer-based bindings between function blocks
 - [ ] Implement a booting : create the 'programm' from given description
 - [ ] Implement full virtual machine
 - [ ] Implement the full set of aX function blocks

** Notes

*** Model of execution

The VM is using model:
 - List of the function block
 - Global memory for variables(connections)
 - The blocks are connected via pointers to the global variables: every connection between output and input is a global variable
 - There is no call subprogram: every call of the subprograms is inlining (converted to the global code)
 -- Might be I change the conecpt of the subprogram call
